Option 1: use [first_name]:
 * pros: we know who is boss, without
   assigning an Issue to oneself
 * cons: if someone else wants to work on this,
         this is quite clumsy

Option 2: use [issue_x], [patch_x]:
 * pros: we know which is it about
 * cons: we don't know who is boss,
   unless he/she assignes him/herself to
   the issue

Vote: 
  * use [first_name] (current): 1x
  * use [issue_x] for Issue x: 3x

Winner: use [issue_x] for Issue x
