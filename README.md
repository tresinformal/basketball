## Game design document

![](design_document_and_issues.png)

> The game design document is written in English.
> Ideally each sentence is `SMAR` (specific, measurable, assignable, relevant,
> see [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)),
> linked to (at least) one Issue.
> The game designers decide what is in the game design document.
> (see Issues what are the criteria for a good Issue)




The game has two players [#13].
The game finishes when on player reaches 20 points.
The game has one basketball [#14].
All objects follow the laws of gravity (Newton's Second Law) [#15].
 There is an option to play on one side or two sides.
There is either one human player and a player controlled by computer or two human players.
There are two baskets, one in the each half of the yard. 
The player's clothes should have diffrent colors. 
The game has a music.
The player can mute it if she/he wants. 
The game counts a time. 
During the game the time shows.

[The game finishes when on player reaches 20 points](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/23).

[The game has two players](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/11).
[The game has one basketball](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/14).
[A basketball's center has a coordinate with an x and a y](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/30).
[The (one) ball starts at the top-center of the screen](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/25).

All objects follow the laws of gravity (Newton's Second Law):

 * the [basketball](https://github.com/tresinformal/basketball/issues/15)
 * [others]

There is an option to play on one side or two sides.

## Issues

> Issues are the technical translation of the game design document.
> Ideally each sentence in the design document results in one Issue.

There are two types of Issues:

 * Testable: deal with the game logic and 
   contains a test in pseudocode (when written by juniors) or 
   C++ (when written by mediors and seniors).
 * Untestable: deal with how the game looks like
   and needs to be verified by a human

We use the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern to separate the game logic,
from the game visualization and input:

## git branching model

![](git_branches.png)

Our `git` branching model:

 * `master`/`main`: a working version
 * `develop`: merging topic branches
 * topic branches: where work is done,
   for example, Issue `x` is done on 
   a branch called `issue_x`
